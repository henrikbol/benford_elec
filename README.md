# Bedford test on US president election 2016

Data is taken from 3.111 Counties results from the election in 2016. Only votes on Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are included.

The Benford's law can be studied in this Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law.

As expected the counts of first digits of the number of votes for the two candidates follow the Benford distribution.
